# Agritech-Smart-Agriculture-monitoring-system

This project implements a smart agriculture monitoring system that utilizes sensors to collect data on crop field parameters, namely temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and nutrient levels (NPK). The system then transmits the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for remote monitoring and analysis. The system aims to empower farmers with seamless and precise control over monitoring, enabling them to make informed decisions, optimize their operations, and achieve superior outcomes.
